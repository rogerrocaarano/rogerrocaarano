# About Me

Software Engineer focused on backend development and scalable architecture.
I primarily work with .NET (C#), applying best practices to build clean, maintainable, and robust APIs. I complement my stack with Python, especially in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and RAG systems.

> I believe software is not just about technology; itâ€™s also about ethics, structure, and clarity. Iâ€™m passionate about building systems that do what theyâ€™re supposed toâ€”without noise or surprisesâ€”and that stand the test of time.
